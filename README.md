## Hi I'm Timur

Web developer focused on frontend architecture,  
UI logic, and responsive layouts.

I build interfaces that are not only good-looking,  
but predictable, structured, and comfortable to use.

### What I do
- build responsive web interfaces
- work with component-based architectures
- think about UI behavior and interaction logic
- experiment with layouts and edge cases


### Tools & technologies
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind
- Git & GitHub


### How I use GitHub
I use this space as a mix of:
- learning journal
- playground for experiments
- place to store real projects and small tools

Not everything here is production-ready —  
but everything reflects how I think and work.


### Selected work
Pinned repositories below highlight:
- layout and UI experiments
- component patterns
- small practical projects


### Currently exploring
- cleaner component structure
- predictable UI state
- better balance between design and logic
